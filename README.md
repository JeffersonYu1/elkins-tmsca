# Elkins High School TMSCA Competition
Tools to enhance the execution of the contest. Written by Jefferson Yu.

## About the Project
### Background
Prior to 2018, Elkins High School hosted an annual TMSCA Math Competition for middle school contestants in the local community. This competition was expanded to encompass elementary, middle, and high school competitors in the 2018-2019 school year. With such an expansion, a logistic challenge arose in managing the increased number of participants and volunteers. In 2018, v1.0.0 of the programs were released, which allowed for ease of registration, grading, and score tabulation throughout the contest.

In 2020, v2.0.0 was released, which fixed issues in the previous version, improved the results PDF appearance and the site layout, and added a new page for volunteer sign-in. 

### Pages
#### Registration
The Registration page allows for coaches to register teams directly through the contest website. Data from each registration are stored into PDF and XLSX files.

#### Results
The Results page gives contest administrators the ability to look at contest scoring in real-time based on data inputted in a Google Sheets. The page outputs a PDF with names of students and schools ranking in the top n places, where n can be customized at the administrator's disposal for every contest category.

#### Volunteer Sign-in
The Volunteer Sign-In page prompts volunteers to input their 6-digit student ID assigned by the school. After querying the appropriate data, the page displays instructions for the volunteer, such as a room number, time, etc., and clocks them in.
